## Usage

### Discord requirements

1. Create yourself a bot at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
2. Manage your bot permissions with bot ID at https://discordapi.com/permissions.html
3. Invite the bot in a server where you are manager

### Run locally

```bash
# get in the project directory and open your terminal
npm install
cat database.sql | mysql -u root -p
node server.js
```

then the bot should be online as long as the nodejs server is running, (note) it's really important to hide your bot token or someone could mess with your discord server by using the bot on his own nodejs server.

### Run with `docker-compose`

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Invite my bot (nothing required)

Client ID: `321041087689129994`

Manage bot permissions then invite it to your server at https://discordapi.com/permissions.html

#### Notes

* _You must be server manager to be able to invite a bot_
* _My bot is not always online since it's currently in development_
